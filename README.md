## Backend Questions
### Answer of Question 1.

For an overview of the system follow the question. So, the design architecture diagram is shown in Fig. 1.1 below. The system starts with 3 microservices: customer service, master data service, and transaction data service. Each microservice is the necessary database owner like a customer database, master data database, and transaction data service respectively. When an external request is received, it is first handled by the API Gateway. This setup aligns with the microservice architecture pattern.

To provide API for display data from 3 microservices above nearly real-time. The design adds a new microservice named Data Aggregate Service to handle aggregate from the 3 microservices above which get data via message broker and return data aggregated back to the client. For the nearly real-time provided data aggregated necessary to have caching data at the Data Aggregate Service.

The component of each microservice is shown in the class diagram in Fig. 1.2 below. API Gateway has the APIGatewayController class which routes the request to internal microservices. All microservices include data aggregate service consisting of controller class handle request, service class handle about business logic as same as. However 3 microservices: customer service, master data service, and transaction data services have entity classes of data that each microservice owns. Every microservices and API gateway has the authorization class with concern about the security of the system.

When have a request to get customer data, master data, and transaction data. Begin The collaboration between the API gateway and each microservice follows the sequence diagram in Fig. 1.3 below. The request is sent to the API gateway first and authorized request by using the userId and token from the request. If the access type is true, the request and parameters like userId and token are sent to the data aggregate service. Before the data aggregate service executes must be authorized by using userId and token same. Next, the operation executed by DataAggregateService starts with call data from the cache. If the cache does not have the data, the service must have call data from  3 microservices via message broker by using a message pattern. Finally, after calling all data successfully the service just aggregates data before saving the data to the cache and return to the client

Finally, the client can call API to get all data with API path name /getDataAggregated and must send the parameter userId and token within the request.
