### Answer 1.

To understand the system overview, please refer to the description below. The provided architectural diagram illustrates the system's design, which begins with three microservices: Customer Service, Master Data Service, and Transaction Data Service. Each microservice has its own database: the Customer Database, the Master Data Database, and the Transaction Data Database, respectively. When an external request is received, it is first handled by the API Gateway. This setup aligns with the microservice architecture pattern.
